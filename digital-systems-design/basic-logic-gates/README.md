# Basic Logic Gates (Verilog)

This folder contains fundamental logic gate modules and testbenches written in Verilog and simulated using Vivado. These projects are part of a digital systems design portfolio focused on RTL implementation and simulation.

## Gates Implemented
- AND
- OR
- NOT (Inverter)
- NAND

Each gate includes a corresponding testbench that simulates all input combinations.

## How to Simulate
1. Open Vivado â†’ Create a new RTL project
2. Add `.v` files for each gate and its testbench
3. Set the testbench (e.g., `and_gate_tb`) as the **top module**
4. Run **Behavioral Simulation** to view waveform and truth table output

## Tools
- Verilog HDL
- Vivado HLx Simulator
