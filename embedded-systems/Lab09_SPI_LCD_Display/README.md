# Lab 09 – SPI LCD Display Control (MSP430FR6989)

## Overview
This lab introduces the use of the **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)** to control a 128x128 pixel LCD on the Educational BoosterPack using the MSP430FR6989. It demonstrates both low-level SPI setup and high-level display rendering using TI’s `grlib` graphics library. The LCD is updated with both static content (logos, shapes, text) and dynamic counters using screen switching and Timer A interrupts.

---

## Key Concepts
- eUSCI_B0 SPI configuration: master mode, 3-pin SPI, 8 MHz bit clock
- SPI pin setup using `P1SELx` for UCB0CLK and UCB0SIMO
- LCD data/command and chip-select pin initialization
- Pixel-based graphics rendering using `grlib`
- Switching between a static image screen (Snoopy logo) and a dynamic UI screen
- Timer A used to periodically increment a counter displayed on the LCD
- Low-level LCD driver calls and font/font color settings

---

## Behavior
- Two display modes are supported:
  1. **Screen 1**: Snoopy logo (static image)
  2. **Screen 2**: Displays shapes, text, and a counter with an incrementing Timer A

- Press **S1** (P1.1) to toggle between screens
- The counter resets when switching to screen 2
- The red LED (P1.0) toggles each loop to indicate activity

## Hardware
- **LCD (Crystalfontz128x128)**: Controlled via SPI
- **SPI MOSI**: P1.6 (UCB0SIMO)
- **SPI CLK**: P1.4 (UCB0CLK)
- **DC Pin**: P1.2
- **CS Pin**: P1.3
- **S1 Button**: P1.1 (toggles screens)
- **Red LED**: P1.0 (blinks on each screen loop)
- **Green LED**: P9.7

## 🎨 Graphics (via GrLib)

This lab uses **TI’s GrLib** graphics library to:
- Draw shapes (rectangles, circles, lines)
- Render text with multiple fonts
- Display an image from `logo.c`
- Switch visual states based on user input

---

## UART?  
UART is not used in this lab — all output is visual via the LCD.

## 📝 SPI Configuration

- Mode: **SPI Mode 0** (Clock polarity 0, phase 0)
- Clock: **SMCLK at 8 MHz**
- Interface: **3-pin SPI** (CS driven manually)
- Half-duplex (LCD only receives data)

---

## Learning Objectives
- Master register-level SPI setup
- Combine low-level hardware config with high-level graphical output
- Handle screen logic and state switching in embedded C
- Manage Timer A interrupts to trigger screen refresh
