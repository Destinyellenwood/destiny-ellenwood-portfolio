# Application 1 ‚Äì Real-Time LED and Telemetry Logger (Space Systems Theme)

**Name:** Destiny Ellenwood  
**UCF ID:** 5276398  
**Course:** Real-Time Systems ‚Äì Summer 2025  
**Theme:** Space Systems üõ∞Ô∏è  
**Application:** Week 1 ‚Äì Rev1  
**AI Use:** Used ChatGPT to help generate comments, function explanations, and bonus timing logic.

##  Overview

This application simulates a **real-time system on a satellite**, where:

- An **LED acts as a beacon**, blinking at a steady 2 Hz rate to indicate system status.
- A **telemetry task** logs a health packet to the console every 10 seconds.

Both tasks run independently using **FreeRTOS**, which ensures the LED blinks on time even when telemetry logging happens.

---

##  Implementation Details

###  `satellite_beacon_task`
- Runs at **2 Hz** ‚Üí LED ON/OFF every 250 ms
- Uses `xTaskGetTickCount()` and `portTICK_PERIOD_MS` to measure the exact time between toggles
- Logs:
  - Whether the beacon is ON or OFF
  - Timestamp
  - Elapsed time since last toggle (i.e., period)

###  `telemetry_task`
- Runs every **10 seconds** (0.1 Hz)
- Prints a telemetry packet ID and system timestamp
- Runs with `vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(10000))`

###  `app_main`
- Sets up GPIO4 as the beacon LED output pin
- Creates both tasks with equal priority (1)

##  Real-Time Design Principles Used

- **Multitasking:** Each task has its own timing and does not block the other.
- **vTaskDelay:** Ensures tasks yield control to the scheduler, maintaining proper CPU usage.
- **Timing Verification:** Used `xTaskGetTickCount()` to confirm both tasks meet their real-time requirements.

##  Bonus Challenges Completed

| Challenge        | Description                                                   | Done |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Easy             | Logged timing for beacon task and changed LED color in Wokwi | ‚úÖ   |
| Medium           | Renamed tasks/variables to match the space theme; used GPIO4  | ‚úÖ   |
| Harder           | Logged actual period between executions for **both** tasks    | ‚úÖ   |

##  How to Run

1. Go to https://wokwi.com and start a new ESP32 Project.
2. In the new project:
    - Replace the default `main.c` with the code from: [Application1/src/main.c](./Application1/src/main.c)
3. Create or replace the `diagram.json` file with the layout from: [Application1/diagram.json](./Application1/diagram.json)
    - Make sure it connects an LED to GPIO 4 as used in the code.
4. (Optional) Add the simulator config from: [Application1/wokwi.toml](./Application1/wokwi.toml)
5. Click the green ‚ÄúStart Simulation‚Äù ‚ñ∂ button in Wokwi.

6. Watch the serial console print:
   - Telemetry packets every 10 seconds
   - Beacon ON/OFF status with precise timing info
