# Hardware Security Projects

This folder contains projects focused on **hardware-based threats, side-channel analysis, and detection methods**, aligning with active research in **secure microelectronics and CAD for security**.  

 **Note:** I am currently taking a dedicated course in **Hardware Security and Trusted Circuit Design** (Fall 2025). This section will be **frequently updated** as I complete each project milestone.

## Projects

###  Project 1: Hardware Trojan Design in AES Crypto-System
- **Goal:** Explore how hardware Trojans can be embedded in AES cryptographic modules.  
- **Approach:** Stepwise design in three parts:
  - Part 1: Trojan insertion at RTL level  
  - Part 2: Simulation and functional validation of compromised AES  
  - Part 3: Analysis of stealthiness and activation mechanisms

###  Project 2: Vulnerabilities of Computing Platforms
- **Goal:** Study microarchitectural information leakage attacks.  
- **Techniques:** Implement and analyze well-known side-channel attacks:
  - Part 1: Timing side channels  
  - Part 2: Branch predictor attacks  
  - Part 3: Cache timing & speculative execution vulnerabilities

###  Project 3: Information Leakage in Cache Coherence Fabric
- **Goal:** Investigate timing channel exploits in multi-core cache coherence protocols.  
- **Focus:**  
  - Part 1: Modeling coherence traffic timing leaks  
  - Part 2: Attack demonstration and measurement
